    <p>Opinions and what's worked for me. YMMV.</p>

    <h2>Write tests first</h2>

    <p>Testable code is good code.</p>

    <p>If you don't do it now, you probably never will.</p>

    <h2>Code quality is king</h2>

    <p> Writing code is easy. Reading it later is hard. </p>
    <p> Write clean code today. </p>
    <p> Bad code shows through in product quality. </p>
    <p> Quality code is faster to add features to. </p>

    <h2>The best code is no code</h2>

    <p>
        Your code can't have bugs if you don't have any code.

    <h2>Sometimes you need code</h2>

    <p>
        Not all projects can have no code.
    </p>
    <p>
        Minimise code when it is needed.
    </p>

    <h2>Don't use frameworks ever</h2>

    <h2>Tools are good</h2>

    <h3>Good.</h3>
    <p>
        Small, focused, clean API.
    </p>

    <h3>Bad.</h3>
    <p>
        Stuff native to JS.
    </p>
    <p>
        Trivial functionality you use once.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/blunderscore">( Anything that namespaces with _ :3 )</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Lock-in API ( frameworky )

    <h2>Vet your deps</h2>

    <h3>
        Shit goes wrong. Plan for it.
    </h3>

    <p> Smaller / fewer deps are easier to debug. </p>

    <p> Look for deps with fewer sub-deps </p>

    <p> Look for deps with TESTS. </p>

    <p> Have confidence, be critical. Don't assume someone knows better than you. </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Picking dependencies</h2>

    <p>READ THE SOURCE</p>
    <sub>( At least skim it, understand how it works )</sub>
    <p>If you can't be bothered reading the source because it is too long, DON'T USE THE LIB.</p>
    <p>Good libs are small.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Sometimes you need to use bad tools</h2>

    <p>EG: Sequelize. Horrible.</p>

    <p>Wrap with something less disgusting. ( roll your own? )</p>

    <p>Don't assume existing wheels are good enough.</p>

    <p>Make wheels that fit your software if need be.</p>

    <h2>Throwback slide. Small is good.</h2>

    <p>The internet is bad. Ship less code.</p>

    <p>If you need to split your bundle, you have too much code.</p>

    <p>Frameworks are HUGE</p>

</section>

<section>
    <h2>Know how to do what you dont have time to do.</h2>

    <p>When looking for or using a tool, try and have a pretty good idea of how to implement it.</p>

    <p>Nothing is magic, everything is easier than it seems.</p>

    <p>You probably could write react.</p>

    <p>If you have no idea how a tool works, try and avoid.</p>

<section>
    <h2>Open the debugger.</h2>

    <p>Code's buggered? use the debugger.</p>

    <p>Do it immediately.</p>

    <p>Don't play with settings to an API or randomly change shit.</p>

    <p>node --inspect myNodeFile.js exists.</p>

    <h2>Don't transpile.</h2>

    <h3>Please, if you take only one thing from this, let it be this point.</h3>

    <p>Transpilation makes EVERYTHING worse.</p>

    <p>No one can read your code</p>

    <p>You can't debug your OWN code.</p>

    <p>You never really know how anything works for sure.</p>

    <p>It takes ages to build, anything over 1s is abhorent.</p>

    <p>*Throwback* - YOU READ CODE MORE THAN YOU WRITE IT. Saving 0.5s to use some wanky feature will cost you and your team minutes/hours of mental parse time in the future.</p>

<section>
    <h2>Always be refactorin'.</h2>

    <p>Past you is an idiot, past you couldn't code for shit. Don't trust past you, you're better than them.</p>

    <p>Find productivity bottlenecks and fix them.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>MODULARISE.</h2>

    <p>Write tiny functions.</p>

    <p>Decouple as much as possible.</p>

    <p>Write wrappers for libraries with bespoke APIs.</p>

    <p>Avoid singletons.</p>

    <h3>So fast, you have no idea.</h3>

    <p>Don't write 'fast' code, you're not writing a physics engine.</p>

    <p>Use inbuilt functions like .map() and .reduce() over custom for-loops</p>

<section>
    <h2>Your computer isn't that fast.</h2>

    <sub>If you are not writing a physics engine or an fft lib, skip this slide.</sub>

    <p>Find hot loops and go to town on your code.</p>

    <p>Use comments in place of good code.</p>

    <p>Really go nuts, best practice is a douche anyway.</p>

    <p>Fast is ugly.</p>
